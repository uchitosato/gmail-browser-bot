Gmail browser reply bot.

We need bot for manual sending and reply like we did with smtp but with browser.
So the bot first need to prepare account like add picture and change password(if new confirm recovery email) as we buy this accs.

Bot must login to account with browser if ask sms it will need to unlock account with sms using service like sms-activate.org with API

Next thing when its send mfirst message, and logout, if there will be reapled message for first message than bot must reply with second message

About usage, we use 50 accs per windows profile, as we setup proxy with windows and 50 accs with one profile, one dedicated server can handle like 10 profiles.

It may ask for captcha from time to time so we use service API like 2captcha.com

Bot must save:
disabled accounts in separate file.


it must store cookies
